which he answers questions. Probability attached to gambling is eliminated. 

Furthermore, under Swiss Federal Games and Casino Act where games of skill 

and games of chance are defined as for onsite or facility casino games, quiz game 

1$Quiz cannot be considered as a gambling activity. In addition, as opposed to 

gambling activity where a portion of the prize is distributed in such a way that one 

player’s success can or does reduce the other players’ chances of winning, in a quiz 

game 1$Quiz the entire prize amount of 1$ is awarded to a single winner selected 

randomly by the server for a single game.
